INTRODUCTION

Heart rate monitoring is an essential part of cardiovascular care, providing important information about the patient and the body. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely used non-invasive technique to measure changes in blood volume in tissues, most commonly in the fingers or ears. The PPG signal captures the pulsatile nature of blood flow, allowing heart rate to be measured.
 
In recent years, signal processing techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis have been used to improve the accuracy of heart rate measurements. FFT is a widely used technique that converts a time-domain signal to its frequency-domain representation and reveals the spectral components of the signal.By applying FFT to the PPG signal, the critical frequency corresponding to the heartbeat will be determined.
 
HRV focuses on analyzing short-term changes in heart rate. These changes are influenced by the autonomic nervous system and provide important information about heart health, stress levels and general health. HRV analysis involves the calculation of several time- and frequency-related parameters, including the mean RR interval, the standard deviation of the RR interval (SDNN), the principal difference parameter constant (RMSSD), and the power band.
 
Heart rate detection of PPG signals can be improved by combining FFT and HRV analysis.FFT provides primarily an initial estimate of heart rate, while HRV analysis provides a more comprehensive assessment of heart rate variability and heart function. This integration allows for more accurate heart rate measurements and can be used in a variety of applications such as remote patient monitoring, exercise tracking and stress measurement.
 


In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of heart rate detection from photoplethysmography signals using fast Fourier transform and HRV analysis. We evaluate the performance of these methods in terms of accuracy, stability, and sensitivity to physical differences. The findings of this study contribute to the advancement of heart rate monitoring and provide insight into the use of PPG signals to assess heart disease.
